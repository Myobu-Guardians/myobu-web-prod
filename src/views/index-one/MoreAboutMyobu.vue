              <p>
                $MYOBU is available as both an ERC20 (Ethereum) & BEP20 (Binance
                Smart Chain) token. Graduating development fees are collected on
                both buy & sell transactions but will never exceed 10% in either
                case. Fees collected are allocated to specific buckets:
                development, staking, play-to-earn, DAO & Shrine. Myobu holders
                are currently able to stake their tokens to earn ETH and/or BSC
                rewards.
              </p>
              <p>
                With Myobu staking, investors can choose single-stake or LP
                staking. You decide how long your tokens are locked. Anywhere
                from 1-52 weeks. The longer you stake, the more weight you hold
                in the pool compared to others. The staking rewards are also
                dependent on volume, so as the volume increases, so do the
                rewards for stakers!
              </p>
              <p>
                Internal snapshot capabilities have been added to $MYOBU to
                allow for future DAO functionalities. We enjoy DAO governance
                over the community DAO fund and certain aspects of the
                ecosystem. Myobu focuses on Play&Earn (P&E) rather than
                Play-to-Earn (P2E) because we believe people should be rewarded
                for gaming. Myobu ensures this idea is at the core of developing
                our own Gamefi ecosystem.
