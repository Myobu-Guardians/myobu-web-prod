Graduating development fees are collected on\n                both buy & sell transactions but will never exceed 5% in either\n                case. Fees collected are allocated to specific buckets:\n                development, staking, play-to-earn, DAO & Shrine. Myobu holders\n                are currently able to stake their tokens to earn ETH and/or BSC\n                rewards.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                With Myobu staking, investors can choose single-stake or LP\n                staking. You decide how long your tokens are locked. Anywhere\n                from 1-52 weeks. The longer you stake, the more weight you hold\n                in the pool compared to others. The staking rewards are also\n                dependent on volume, so as the volume increases, so do the\n                rewards for stakers!\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Internal snapshot capabilities have been added to $MYOBU to\n                allow for future DAO functionalities. We enjoy DAO governance\n                over the community DAO fund and certain aspects of the\n                ecosystem. Myobu focuses on Play&Earn (P&E) rather than\n                Play-to-Earn (P2E) because we believe people should be rewarded\n                for gaming. Myobu ensures this idea is at the core of developing\n                our own Gamefi ecosystem.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Our team aims to build serious products with real-life utilities\n                that could benefit the web3 world and individuals' lives.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                We are a team of developers, designers, and marketers passionate\n                about blockchain technology.
